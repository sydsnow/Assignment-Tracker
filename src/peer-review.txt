Functionality of the Vue.js component (4 points)
-> The functionality of the AssignmentTracker.vue looks great. The toggle functionality of showing/ hiding the completed assignments has been implemented
    very nicely with the use of a button. Sydnee's method of displaying the remaining dates of an assignment is done very well and is shown correctly on 
    the tracker. She used vue properly to render the assignment data from the JSON file to her component. She included an assignments.json file to display 
    the details for each assignments. 4/4

Effectiveness of the UI/UX  (2 points)
-> Sydnee displayed creativeness of displaying which assignments are completed by including a green coloured checked box to her assignment tracker. I like
    how she matched the background colour of the checked box to the 'show/hide' button. I also really like how she implemented the checked boxes to each 
    assignment to allow users to check which assignments are completed along the way. And when the assignment has been checked, it goes to the completed
    section which I think is very cool! 2/2

Code cleanliness and organization (2 points)
-> Sydnee removed all of the unused folders/files that were in the initial project folder. The assignments.json file looks very well organized and has all
    of the criteria that Josh is looking for with the Assignment Tracker. The AssignmentTracker.vue file has a nicely organized with the script tags and 
    template tags. 2/2

Collaboration effort and peer review completion (2 point)

Overall I give Sydnee's assignment tracker a 10/10 for having proper functionality to it and a very cute design to it!
